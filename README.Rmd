# hw04pjenyuh

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->
Author: Jen-Yu Huang   

The goal of hw04pjenyuh is to create a function which return output of a recursive sequence and plot the output to a line plot

## Installation

You can install the released version of hw04pjenyuh by asking me for a copy

``` r
install.packages("hw04pjenyuh")
```

## Example

To run the package

```{r}
library(hw04pjenyuh)
```

Find the fifth element of the recursive sequence generated by (2, 4, 3):

```{r n}
myseq_n(x = c(2, 4, 3), n = 5)
```

Plot the output of the sequence generated by (2, 4, 3) for n = 3 to 9:

```{r plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
myseq_plot(data.frame(2, 4, 3, 3:9))
```
